           * SDLC - it is a process used by software industry to design , develop , and test high quality softwares .
           * The SDLC aims to produce a high quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations recahes 
           * completion within times and cost estimates 
           * 
           * 
           * STLC - it is sequence of different activties perfoemed by testing team to ensure the quality of software 
           * or the product 
           * 
           * questioning the requirements - tester will do 
           * 
           * -- writing test cases 
           * -- requirements are base line , our BA calls for a SRS requirement meeting , we get end to end clarification or walkthrogh 
           * -- will check for system architecture , HLD , LLD  
           * 
           * -- stub - 
           * A stub is a piece of code or a function that acts as a placeholder for another component, 
           * module, or system that is not yet implemented or available. Stubs are often used in software development 
           * and testing to simulate the behavior of missing or external components.
Unit Testing:

Stubs simulate dependencies of a unit under test, allowing isolated testing of the unit.
Example: If a function depends on a database, a stub can return mock data instead of querying the database.
Integration Testing:

Stubs are used to test interactions between systems by replacing external services with simulated ones.
Component Development:

While developing a large system, stubs can represent unfinished parts of the application.
Distributed Systems:

In remote procedure calls (RPCs), stubs can act as proxies for remote methods.
